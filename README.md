<h1 align="center">üë©üèª‚ÄçüíªHi! I'm Sara, and I'm a fullstack software engineer</h1>
<p align="left">Hello! My name is Sara, and I am a fullstack software engineer. Influenced by my dad (who was also a software engineer), I took an interest in programming and web development at a very young age and spent a large portion of my adolescent years at the computer. After I graduated high school, I decided to pursue other interests professionally, but programming remained one of my number one hobbies. I created my own private masseuse business in 2016 and maintained it until 2021, when I was forced to stop due to the health and safety regulations implemented as a result of the pandemic. 

While in quarantine, I began taking my interest in programming a lot more seriously, and decided to study frontend development on my own. After a year and a half of building amateur websites and web apps using various frontend languages and frameworks, I finally decided to officially pursue an education in fullstack software engineering in the hopes of turning something I was passionate about into a career. I applied for, and was accepted to, App Academy, where I spent well over 80 hours a week for 6 months learning various languages and technologies on both the front end and the back end. On top of these languages and technologies, I also learned valuable skills such as learning and implementing languages and frameworks very quickly, working on projects with other developers, and adhering to each language's best practice ruleset.

Now that I have graduated from App Academy, I am eager to turn my dream of doing what I'm passionate about professionally into a reality. In the meantime, I am constantly working on honing my existing skills as well as continuing to learn all that I can about software engineering.</p>
